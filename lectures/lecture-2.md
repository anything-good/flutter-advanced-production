• Looking into similar project ideas for inspiration  
• Analysing design images and turning them into code.  
• Building the base widgets.  
• Organising widgets in screens.  

1. **Introduction**: Start by welcoming your students and giving a brief overview of what they'll learn in this lecture. Explain that they'll be learning how to transform a design image into responsive Flutter code.

2. **Building the Welcome Screen**: Begin by showing them a simple design for a welcome screen. Explain the different components of the screen (like the logo, welcome message, and sign-in button) and how they correspond to different widgets in Flutter. Then, live code the welcome screen, explaining each step as you go.

3. **Looking into Similar Project Ideas for Inspiration**: Show your students some examples of similar projects or apps. Discuss how these apps are structured and what widgets they might use. This will help your students understand how to approach their own projects.

4. **Analysing Design Images and Turning Them into Code**: Now, take a more complex design image and break it down into its constituent parts. Explain how each part of the design corresponds to a widget in Flutter. For example, a card in the design might correspond to a `Card` widget in Flutter. Then, live code this design, explaining each step as you go.

5. **Building the Base Widgets**: Discuss the concept of base widgets in Flutter. Explain that these are the fundamental building blocks of any Flutter app. Show your students how to create and use some common base widgets, like `Container`, `Row`, `Column`, and `Text`.

6. **Organising Widgets in Screens**: Finally, explain how to organize widgets within screens. Show your students how to create a new screen, add widgets to it, and navigate between screens. You could also discuss the concept of widget tree in Flutter and how it affects the layout and performance of the app.

7. **Wrap Up**: Summarize what your students have learned in this lecture. Encourage them to practice turning design images into code and to experiment with different widgets and layouts. Remind them that building a responsive UI in Flutter is all about understanding and effectively using widgets.

Remember to take breaks in between to ensure that your students have time to digest the information and ask questions.
